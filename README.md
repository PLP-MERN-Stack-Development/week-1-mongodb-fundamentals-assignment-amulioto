# üìö MongoDB Fundamentals Assignment ‚Äì PLP Bookstore Project

This is my completed assignment for learning MongoDB basics. It includes creating a database, inserting book data, performing CRUD operations, running advanced queries, using aggregation pipelines, and adding indexes for optimization.

---

## üß† What This Project Includes

I created a MongoDB project with the following:

- A database called `plp_bookstore`
- A `books` collection with 12 sample book documents
- Queries to:
  - Create, update, and delete documents
  - Filter, sort, and paginate data
  - Analyze data using aggregation
  - Add indexes and check performance with `.explain()`

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Make sure you have one of the following:

- MongoDB installed locally OR  
- A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) cluster

You also need:

- [MongoDB Shell (mongosh)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell)  
  or  
- [MongoDB Compass GUI](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)

---

### üß™ Steps to Run

1. **Open your terminal or mongosh**
2. **Insert the book data**:

   ```bash
   mongosh < insert_books.js
Run my queries:

Open the queries.js file and copy each query into your shell to test it step-by-step.

You can also explore the database using MongoDB Compass.
